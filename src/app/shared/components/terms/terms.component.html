    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to CherryPick (the “**Platform**”), a cloud–based **workflow
      assistant** for commercial‑real‑estate professionals—including landlords,
      tenants, brokers, developers, investors, and property owners (“**Users**,”
      “**you**,” “**your**”).
    </p>
    <p>
      The Platform is owned and operated in Egypt by **Majisa** (“**Company**,”
      “**we**,” “**us**,” “**our**”). *[Majisa’s final legal entity designation
      will be added once confirmed].*
