        <h1>1. Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [Feb 11, 2025]</p>
        <p>
            Welcome to <strong>CherryPick.com</strong> (the “Platform”), operated by NetStartups, LLC 
            (“NetStartups,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your use 
            of and access to the Platform, along with any related features, tools, services, or 
            applications (collectively, the “Services”).
        </p>
        <p>
            By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not 
            agree, you may not use the Services.
        </p>
    
        <h2>1.1 Description of Services</h2>
        <p>
            We provide workflow tools and data services primarily for commercial real estate (CRE) 
            professionals. Our Services include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Publicly Available Data:</strong> Aggregated property, company, landlord, 
                tenant, and person data (“Base Data”) sourced from public records and other publicly 
                accessible resources.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User-Generated Content (“UGC”):</strong> Tools that enable you and other users 
                to upload, enrich, and generate additional data, such as property details or marketing 
                materials.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Enrichment & Generation Tools:</strong> Features allowing you to organize, 
                refine, and produce materials (e.g., brochures) for prospective clients or internal use.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <em>Important Note:</em> We do not operate as a property listing service or a proprietary data 
            provider. We aim to enhance CRE workflows by letting you leverage publicly available 
            information and your own user-generated or -enriched data. You are responsible for ensuring 
            any data you upload or use does not violate third-party rights or applicable laws.
        </p>
    
        <h2>1.2 Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
            You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, and fully 
            able to enter into a legally binding contract. By using the Services, you represent and 
            warrant that all registration information you submit is accurate and truthful.
        </p>
    
        <h2>1.3 Account Creation & Security</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Account Registration:</strong> Some features require creating an account. You agree 
            to provide current, accurate information during sign-up.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Security:</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your 
            login credentials and for all activity under your account.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Notification:</strong> If you suspect unauthorized use of your account, notify us 
            immediately at <a href="mailto:support&#64;cherrypick.com">support&#64;cherrypick.com</a>.
        </p>
    
        <h2>1.4 Data Ownership & User-Generated Content</h2>
        <h3>Base Data (Publicly Available Data)</h3>
        <p>
            We collect and organize data from public records, publicly accessible websites, and other 
            open sources. We claim no exclusive ownership over inherently public data. We only assert 
            the rights necessary to display, organize, and provide analytics around such data.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Ownership of UGC</h3>
        <p>
            You retain all ownership rights to any content (text, images, documents, data points, etc.) 
            you submit, upload, or enrich using the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
            By submitting UGC, you grant NetStartups a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, 
            sublicensable license to use, reproduce, adapt, display, distribute, and analyze such UGC 
            as necessary to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operate and improve the Services;</li>
            <li>Generate aggregated or anonymized market insights;</li>
            <li>Enhance workflow and analytics features for users (including you).</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Public vs. Private Data Settings</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>User Designation:</strong> You may label certain enriched or uploaded data as 
            “private” (visible only to you or designated team members) or “public” (visible to other 
            users or the broader Platform community).
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Platform Discretion for Public Data:</strong> If content or data is derived from 
            public records or clearly publicly available sources, we reserve the right to classify it 
            as public—even if you have marked it private—where legally permissible.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Default Settings:</strong> In the absence of a clear user designation, NetStartups 
            may, at its discretion, determine the data’s visibility status, especially if its public 
            nature is self-evident.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Prohibited UGC</h3>
        <p>
            You agree not to upload content that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Violates any law or regulation;</li>
            <li>Infringes upon any third-party’s intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or 
            contractual rights;</li>
            <li>Is defamatory, obscene, libelous, or otherwise objectionable;</li>
            <li>Contains unauthorized personal data or third-party confidential information.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Responsibility & Liability</h3>
        <p>
            You are solely responsible for the UGC you provide. We reserve the right, but are not 
            obligated, to remove or disable UGC that we believe violates these Terms or applicable law.
        </p>

        <h2>1.13 Changes to the Terms</h2>
        <p>
            We may modify these Terms periodically. If we make material changes, we will update the

            <li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe the removal was in error;</li>
            <li>A statement consenting to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in Washington, D.C.
